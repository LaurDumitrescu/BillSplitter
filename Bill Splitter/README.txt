=============================== Bill Spliiter Application ===============================

The purpose of this application is to create a bill calculator so that there is 
no confusion between people's total at a restaurant and each one of the clients 
knows how much he has to pay + tips.

The application works in a GUI created in Swing on only one frame and has components 
such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea.

Usage:
- the client prompts the number of people and each of their names including themselves 
in the console of an IDE
- the main user inserts all the products that have been ordered by adding the name, price 
and quantity in the designated JTextField/s then pressing Add button 
- if the group wants to see the total and the tip the user will click on the Total JButton 
which will show in the left JTextArea the total price and the tip
- when a person wants to select his products he clicks on the JButton that shows its name 
and selects from the right JTextArea the product he ordered and places the 
quantity in the lower JTextField, then simply pressing the lower Add JButton 
that will bind the product to that specific name
- if each user has prompted his products the main user will click on the Customer Total 
JButton which will display alphabetically the persons' name and also alphabetically the 
products they have consumed followed by the tip per customer
- when the client wants to clear the screen it will click on the Clear JButton

Further Add-ons:
- cleaner view of the components
- faster way for a person to add his products
- GUI prompting details for the number of people and their names
